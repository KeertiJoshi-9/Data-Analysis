**Delhivery - Business Case Study**

Introduction:
  Delhivery, India's leading and rapidly growing integrated player, has set its sights on creating the commerce operating system. They achieve this by utilizing world-class infrastructure, ensuring the highest quality in logistics operations, and harnessing cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.

Why this case study?
From Delhiveryâ€™s Perspective:

  - Delhivery aims to establish itself as the premier player in the logistics industry. This case study is of paramount importance as it aligns with the company's core objectives and operational excellence.
  - It provides a practical framework for understanding and processing data, which is integral to their operations. By leveraging data engineering pipelines and data analysis techniques, Delhivery can achieve several critical goals.
  - First, it allows them to ensure data integrity and quality by addressing missing values and structuring the dataset appropriately.
  - Second, it enables the extraction of valuable features from raw data, which can be utilized for building accurate forecasting models.
  - Moreover, it facilitates the identification of patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations crucial for optimizing their logistics operations.
  - By conducting hypothesis testing and outlier detection, Delhivery can refine their processes and further enhance the quality of service they provide.

From Learners' Perspective:

  - Learners will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and cleaning, which is often the most time-consuming aspect of data analysis.
  - Feature engineering is a critical step in building machine learning models. In this case study, learners will understand how to extract meaningful features from raw data, including datetime manipulation and column splitting.
  - The case study introduces learners to the concept of grouping data based on specific keys and then aggregating it. This is a key aspect of data analysis, especially when dealing with time-series data or data with a hierarchical structure.
  - Learners will perform hypothesis testing, to validate assumptions and draw insights from data.
  - The case study goes beyond data analysis by focusing on deriving actionable insights for a business. Learners will understand how data analysis can drive informed decision-making and recommendations.

**Business Insights:**

  - There are approximately 14787 unique trip IDs given in the dataset which comprises of just 2 months worth data.
  - Carting is the top route type used.
  - Top 5 Source states from where the trip is created are : Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Tamil nadu, Telangana. This means that the sellers are majorly based in these states.
  - Bottom source and destination states are majorly from North-East (Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram etc.)
  - Top 5 destination states where the trip ended are : Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Tamil nadu, Uttar Pradesh. This means that the customers ordering are majorly based in these states.
  - Top cities sourcing and collecting the orders are Mumbai, Bangalore and NCR regions.
  - Actual time and Segment actual time are similar to each other in the dataset.
  - Actual time and OSRM time are significantly different.
  - OSRM distance and Segment OSRM distance are significantly different.
  - OSRM time and Segment OSRM time are significantly different.
  - Average time taken for each trip to complete is around 5 hours (4.98 hours precisely).

**Recommendation/ Actionable Items:**

  - Central, Eastern and North-Eastern corridors have significantly less traffic, with very less trips. Delhivery can improve their business and logistics in these areas.
  - Maharashtra and Karnataka have the highest trips, Delhivery can introduce loyalty programs for customer retention. Also, improve the speed of deliveries in these segments since it greatly impacts the revenue of the company.
  - Actual time and OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) said time are most of the times not matching and are statistically different. The OSRM planning certainly needs improvement.
  - Delhivery agents need to follow OSRM distance which is the most economic instead of deflecting from it that increases the distance as well as time taken.
